# Frenzy AI Product Filter

## Installation

1. Run the ```npm run build command```

2. Import the ```frenzy-ai-widget.css``` and the ```frenzy-ai-widget.js``` into your shopify ```assets``` folder from the ```dist``` folder generated by the build command.

3. Create a ```frenzy-ai-product-filter.liquid``` file in your ```sections``` folder

4. Add the following code to it

```
{{ 'frenzy-ai-widget.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag: preload: true }}

<div id="frenzy-ai-widget"></div>

<script type="application/json" id="frenzy-data">
    {
        "vendors": {{ shop.vendors | json }},
        "productTypes": {{ shop.types | json }}
    }
</script>
<script src="{{ 'frenzy-ai-widget.js' | asset_url }}" defer></script>

{% schema %}
{
  "name": "t:names.frenzy_ai_product_filter",
  "disabled_on": {
    "groups": ["header", "footer"]
  },
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "t:names.frenzy_ai_product_filter"
    }
  ]
}
{% endschema %}
```

> **Note:** that in the schema I have used a variable from the locales for correct multilanguage names. If you don't want that, you can hard code the name directly. *You must create a name for this section E.g. "Frenzy AI Product Filter"


5. Now go onto your collections page and add the section with the name you assigned it

That's it, should be ready for use.

# Features
Responsive design

The Cart Drawer has smooth transitions, skeleton and I added a reactive drawer (using a portal) that selects the category of filter that you interact with for you and expands it

The cart drawer has app like behavior so that when it's expanded, users on mobile can hit the back button to close it

# Optimizations
Adding new filters in the future is very easy, such as filter by size, colors, etc. Just adding a few parameters

Only queries for a set number of products (20) configured by the PAGE_SIZE variable and then queries for 20 more on scroll. Prevents race conditions by canceling previous requests if we make one on top of another

It includes a query in the graphQL query to get the currency symbol for the product card. It uses the correct currency and currency symbol for international stores

Images are optimized by shopify's backend, and the browser takes care of selecting the right image based on the user's device using the srcset attribute
